Visit our github!

How to download:

1) Open our github page at https://github.com/RogersResources/main

2) Press "Code"

3) Press "Download ZIP"

4) Extract the ZIP (you may need to right-click)

5) Rename the "main-main" folder from the ZIP to something else, like "ELAR Notes" of "Coding Projects"

That should make a "RogersResources" folder or a "main-main" folder in your folder that you made.
The "main-main" folder will contain all the games you could wish for.


To find a game, simply go to your **files and search the game up!**

**We will be working on a better search interface. It should be ready soon.**
